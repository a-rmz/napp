# Napp: Feature list
The [PROPOSAL](./PROPOSAL.md) document mentioned some of the features required for Napp to be considered in MVP status, they were:
* RTIM (Real-time inline Markdown) Support
* Key shortcuts to add the stylings (bold, italics, code blocks, etc…)
* Sidebar with list of notes
* Export/Save notes to `.md` files
* Integration with Medium

Note that it is a very limited list which does not describe all the functionality I would like the app to have. This document can be considered as the "roadmap" for the app, where all the features and (hopefully not, but most likely) bugs will be listed for development.
